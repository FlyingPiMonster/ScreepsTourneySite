# Summer 2017: The RCL Challenge

Level 8 rooms are the best. You get observers, a third spawn, a power spawn, and NUKES!!!!! But can your code get you there?

The challenge is to level up a room as far as you can in 24 hours. Starting at RCL 1 in a predefined room layout, you must do whatever you deem necessary to get that room to the highest level you can. Are you up for the challenge?

[Read the official rules](rules.htm) and [submit your code!](/submit_code.htm)
